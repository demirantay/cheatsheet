# React Docs Notes

- These notes are taken from the [main documentation guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Getting Started

- You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets. When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!

### Add a New React App

- As we said above you can add react as much or as little as you can to your app so if you would like to start out small just add a simple html script tag and build it from there. There will be no complicated tools or install requirements.

  First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:
  ```html
  <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->

  <div id="like_button_container"></div>

  <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->
  ```

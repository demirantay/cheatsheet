# Security in the World of Web Applications

- Before we dive into studying web security we will first see it's history and see what went wrong in it.

### Information security in a nutshell

- `Filrting with formal solutions` -- it is assumed that there is no single framework out there for security measurements like there is for other stacks of the software.security i mostly matured around the application itself.

- `Enlightenment Through Taxonomy` -- Some groups such as the homeland security tried to theorie a definition for software security through taxonomy of the attacks in different categories but to be gonest it hasn't theorized anything.

- `Towered Practical Approaches` -- Even through we haven't theroized anything the following practice has worked for us thus far:
  - Learning from (preferably other peoples) mistakes 
  - Developing tools to detect and correct problems 
  - Planning to have everything compromised
  
 ### A Brief History of the Web
 
 - Webs emprie has been built on shaky grounds and the reason for that is because of the web browsers.
 
 - `Tales of stone age: 1945 to 1994` -- From the first computers (1940) to 1990s computer networking was pretty much non existent or just not user friendly software. Thats untill Tim berners Lee and Don Connoly had developed a new approach. They created the first versions of HTML, HTTP, IP, domain names ... etc. that creted the Web (1.0)
	
	After that the first bowsers such as Mosaic started popping up. Mosaic later renamed netscape and then got aquired and turned into internet explorer of microsoft.
	
- `The first browser wards: 1995 to 1999` -- Once software giants like microsoft realized the importance of the internet all of them started and arms race to build the best internet explorer.

	New things got developed such as flash, javascript. The result of this arms race from the vendors resulted in undocumented and not safe code to be produced ni order to win the race. Most of the security problems we face today are caused by this race and the bad code written with it.

- `The Boring Period: 200 to 2003` -- After microsoft winning the browser wards. It did not invest init anymore. But even in this boring period we still received something magnificent.

	Microsoft released "XMLHttpRequest" API. at the time it seemed like a small quirk for the web browsers, but in tme this API made it possible for what would be called "WEB 2.0"
	
- `Web 2.0 and the Second Browser WArds: 2004 and beyond` -- With XMLHttpRequest the popularity of the Web blew up. But with it brought security issues with it.

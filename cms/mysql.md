## Mysql Notes

```bash
# To enter the Mysql Shell with RDBMS password
mysql -u root -p
```

- I put qwerty... for my local computer if it asks for password
- Normally you should change your password and remember it.
- But you can always rechange the password.


```bash
# new database
mysql> CREATE DATABASE test_db;

# To make created_db the current database, use this statement:
mysql> USE test_db
Database changed
```

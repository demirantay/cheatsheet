# Torzcon - Engineering a Compiler

## Chapter 1: Overview of Compilation

- Compilers are just computer programs that translate a program written in one language into a program written in another language.

- To translate a text from one language to another you must understand both form, syntax and content or meaning of the input language. Finally it needs a scheme for mapping content from the source language to the target language. The structure of a compile derives from the observations above.

- Typical source languages might be C, C++, Java. The target language is usually the instruction set of some processor.

- Some compilers (usually research) translate from another language to a high level language like C because they don't want to hassle of an instruction set. These compilers are called "source-to-source translators"

- A "interpreter" is basically the same as a cmopiler but instead of outputting an executable file. It just executes it directly.

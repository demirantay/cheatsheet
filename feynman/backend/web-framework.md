# Web Framework

Basically what are web frameworks? In a nutshell web frameworks are tools coded for us to ease the development of websites. Historically When the World Wide Web began all of the websites were static so there was no use for tools. But after a while people wanted to input some data to their servers so that began the ageog dynamic programming in web. At that time instead of developing tools for each of the needs, people started combining the tools and creating libraries which we call web frameworks of today.

Most web frameworks are based on the MVC software design pattern. This pattern is traditionally used for desktop GUI's however it has become popular among web developers. MVC stands for Model, View and Controller. Lets see what each of them has to offer:
  - Models - are the control part of the application it holds the data logic and rules of the app
  - Views - are the representation of the data such as HTML, files, JSON, char ... etc.
  - Controllers - Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

In web frameworks people are using three tier organization. The three physical tiers are: client, application, and database. The database is normally a RDBMS, the application controls the business logic and running on a server which then communicates with client using HTTP.

Web frameworks can be divided into two sides, the frontend and the backend.

Each web framework typically has three core features. Yes, some of them has additional ones such as a local development web server. Here are the main ones:
- Web template system
- Caching system
- Security
- Database access, mapping and configuration
- URL mapping
- AJAX
- Tools for creating API's

Lets see what each one does:
- web template engine is basically a engine that takes html with speical tags and database data and outputs a HTML file.
- Caching is used to reduce bandwith usage and server load.
- Database mapping and configuration - many web frameworks create a database backend api, enabling web applications to work with a variety of databases without having to touch raw SQL or rdbms commands.
- URL mapping - this is basically a emchnanism to interpret URLS ...

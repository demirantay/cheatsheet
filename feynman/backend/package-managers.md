# Package Managers

A package manager is basically a piece of software that downloads and installs software. Your phone has one (Google Play Store, Apple App Store), PHP has Composer, there are dozens of examples.

Back in the day you would make install software and it was a total pain in the ass to remove. Usually you would just rebuild the system.

Package Management was a godsend that makes it so you can uninstall cleanly

But more importantly..it allows you to install software through declarative and programmatic methods. The uninstalling is secondary.

# Frontend Frameworks

- `What` -> So basically I think to further the modularisation of web development - basically to create UI components that can be plugged in like Lego bricks and avoid the repetition of code

- `How` -> Just like in backend frontend frameworks are written by other developers so that you do not have to re-invent the wheel, most of them are written in javascript so it is easy to understand. Most popular ones as of 2022 are React, Vue and Angular.

- `Why` -> After a while it gets out of hand to write css, javascript, html for every piece of component you can think of in a large application without any help of a framework, of course you can do it but why try to light a fire with sticks and stones when you already have a lighter?

- `Where` -> Most frontend frameworks use a package manager such as npm, yarn and other build tools such as webpack in order to autmate the donwloading and compliing of the code. You can create a seperate service just for your frontend and connect to your backend from there or you can build your frontend framrwork directly into your backend code and have a monolithic single codebase.

- `When` -> Usually, if you are building something under 10.000 LOC (which is a small project) you do not need a frontend framework. You can just simply write html, css, and javascript it will be muuuch faster and easily maintanable. However, if you are planning on writing something bigger which will be continously maintained and added new features to it is always best to start out with a frameowrk. However, do not sweat it too much; you can always swicth in the middle of the development and start gradually adding frontend frameworks. Thats the beauty of it.

SDK stands for Software Development Kit.

Let's say you want to design a car. You have this rad idea of how to make a sleek, snazzy car that looks nice and is comfortable to drive. Your main focus is on the user experience.

But you have a problem. You don't know the first thing about building a working engine. Or maybe you could, in theory, but you don't have the time or resources to start making your own from scratch.

Not to worry! There are companies out there that just build engines. They took care of that hard part so no one needs to reinvent engines for their cars if they don't want to. The engines are generic and can be fit into just about any car. These generic engines come with a big instruction manual that describes all of the details of what the engine needs to work. How much room it needs, where the mount points to the frame will be, where the hoses and pipes hook up, etc. You can take these instructions and design your car without the engine, then when it's time to test the whole car, you can just drop the engine in and it should all just work.

That set of instructions for software development is called an API. Developers can create pieces of software with critical components "missing", but at the end, they can drop in someone else's code into the blank spots and it will "just work" because the software was designed to work with those slot-in pieces. Large chunks of code like this are, funnily enough, also called "engines".

An SDK is more or less the instructions (API) and the engine bundled together, often with extra tools to help with designing and testing.

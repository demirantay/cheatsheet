# CI CD

Continuous Integration (CI): Think of it like adding a new ingredient to a recipe. Every time a developer makes a small change to the code (like adding a new feature or fixing a bug), that change is immediately mixed into the main codebase. This happens frequentlyâ€”multiple times a day, if needed. The idea is to catch any problems early before they become big issues.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Once those changes are integrated, they need to be shared with users. Continuous Deployment automates this process. It means that as soon as the code is integrated and tested, it automatically gets pushed to the live application where users can see and use the new changes. If you prefer, you might use Continuous Delivery instead, which stops short of automatically deploying to production but ensures the code is always ready to be deployed.

In essence, CI/CD helps developers work together smoothly, quickly spot and fix issues, and deliver new features or fixes to users faster and more reliably.

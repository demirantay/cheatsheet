🔑 `Motto` → *“I want these 2 hours in my schedule to give me ruthless pragmatic information that will aid me in my financial and mission goals. Sometimes it can lend me information about secondary goals as well, such as learning how to play the piano.”*

💻 `Mental Computer` 
- Input → 2 deep work hours
- Processing + memory →

    - 1 - Primary Importance.——-→ (high-income skill)
    - 2 - Secondary Importance  -→ (value skill)

🗺️ `Roadmap Tool`
- 0 - At the moment this is very primitive I could not find a way to create this.
- 1 - Search google for “X learning roadmap” and scan the first 30 pages.
- 2 - Search Reddit for “X learning roadmap” and scan everything that pops up.
- 3 - Sketch the learning steps
- 4 - Build the learning checkboxes in GitHub.

🪴`Learning Tool` →
- 🌿 1) Sharpen the axe (learn terminology, note terminology, build practical noting structure, build cheatsheet structure, Feynman structure)
- 🌿 2) Create a tree-like learning map for the subject
- 🌿 3) Figure out weak links on the roadmap and drill them in. (learning happens on difficulty)
- 🌿 4) Build practical notes (not copy-paste)
- 🌿 5) Build cheatsheet notes
- 🌿 6) Test yourself (active recall) (do not test memorization, test ability by building and applying your skills in a project)
- 🌿 7) Get intense critical feedback.
- 🌿 8) Don't over-learn by asking too much “why”
- 🌿 9) Spaced Repetition system additions
- 🌿 10) Teach (Feynman Technique)

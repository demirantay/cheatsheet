# Practice

> Create a blog and social media postings for all of the below

- `Every Programmer Should Code at least Once`:
  - [ ] Reimplement every major data structure (linked list, maps/hashes, sets, stacks and queues, etc) (WEB)
  - [ ] Write a basic arcade games using graphics (Pong, RogueLike) (WEB)
  - [ ] A program that controls something in the outside world in some way (a robot, via an Arduino, etc)
  - [ ] Write an interpreter for a programming language
  - [ ] Write your own text editor/IDE (heavily customizing it with keyboard shortcuts and extra features to match your workflow). (WEB)
  - [ ] Write your own basic webserver, hook it up to the internet, and host a basic website from it.
  - [ ] Create a basic database (something similar to sqlite)
  - [ ] Write your own operating system (or make a heavily customized one based on Linux or something)

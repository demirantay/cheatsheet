## A.I.D.A

Getting the attention of your target audience is just the first step in converting them into customers. That's where the AIDA principle comes in. AIDA stands for:
  - Attention
  - Interest
  - Desire
  - Action
  
  It's a powerful marketing tool that can help you take your audience from initial awareness to taking action.
  
  The AIDA principle is a psychological model that outlines the steps that a customer goes through when considering a purchase. The first step is to get the customer's attention, then you need to build their interest in your product or service. Next, you must create a desire for your product, and finally, you need to encourage the customer to take action and make a purchase.
  
  To use the AIDA principle effectively, you need to create marketing materials that are designed to move your audience through each stage. Your marketing materials should be attention-grabbing, interesting, and desirable, and they should include a clear call to action that motivates your audience to take action.
  
  One effective way to use the AIDA principle is to create a marketing funnel. A marketing funnel is a series of steps that take your audience from initial awareness to taking action. The steps in a marketing funnel might include things like website visits, email sign-ups, and product demos. By moving your audience through the marketing funnel, you can build a relationship with them and guide them toward making a purchase.
  
  
## Account Based Marketing (ABM)

Account Based Marketing (ABM) is a strategic approach to marketing that focuses on engaging with high-value accounts and customers. Unlike traditional marketing methods that aim to reach as many people as possible, ABM is all about targeting specific, high-value accounts and tailoring your marketing efforts to them.

ABM has been gaining traction in recent years, and for good reason. By focusing on a smaller group of high-value accounts, ABM allows marketers to create highly personalized and effective marketing campaigns. This targeted approach can help you to build stronger relationships with your customers, drive more revenue, and improve your overall marketing ROI.

- 1 - Identify your target accounts: 
 
    The first step in ABM is to identify which accounts you want to target. Consider factors such as account size, industry, and buying behavior to help you determine which accounts are most valuable to your business.
- 2 - Develop a buyer persona: 
  
  Once you have identified your target accounts, it's time to develop a buyer persona. A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. This will help you to understand the motivations, goals, and pain points of your target audience, so that you can tailor your marketing efforts to them more effectively.
- 3 - Create personalized campaigns: 

  With your target accounts and buyer persona in mind, it's time to create personalized campaigns. This could include things like personalized email campaigns, direct mail, or even events. The key is to create campaigns that are highly relevant and engaging for your target audience.
- 4 - Measure your success: 

    Finally, it's important to measure your success and make any necessary adjustments. Use metrics such as website traffic, engagement rates, and conversion rates to help you understand how your ABM efforts are impacting your business.

By focusing on a smaller group of high-value accounts and creating highly personalized campaigns, ABM can help you to achieve your marketing goals more effectively.
  
## Buyer (User) Persona

As a marketer, your ultimate goal is to reach your target audience and provide them with products and services that meet their needs. To do this, you need to have a clear understanding of who your target audience is, what their needs are, and how you can best meet those needs. This is where the concept of the "buyer (user) persona" comes into play.

  A buyer persona is a fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers. By creating a buyer persona, you can gain a deeper understanding of your target audience and tailor your marketing efforts to meet their specific needs. There are several key elements to consider when creating your buyer persona, including:
  - demographics (age, gender, income, education level)
  - behavior patterns
  - motivations
  - goals

  Understanding behavior patterns, such as the websites they visit and the type of content they engage with, can help you determine the most effective channels for reaching your target audience. Motivations and goals are also important elements to consider when creating your buyer persona. 
  - What drives your target audience to make a purchase? 
  - What are their end goals in using your products or services? 

  Once you have created your buyer persona, it is important to use this information to guide all of your marketing efforts, from the content you create to the channels you use to reach your target audience. This will help ensure that your efforts are more targeted and effective, ultimately leading to better conversion rates and a higher return on investment. Understanding your buyer (user) persona is a crucial component of effective marketing. By taking the time to research and create a detailed representation of your ideal customer, you can tailor your marketing efforts to meet their specific needs and drive better results.

## Churn

Churn is a metric used to measure the rate at which customers are leaving a business. It is a critical measurement for any company, as it directly impacts the bottom line and long-term success of the business

The first step in preventing churn is to understand what it is and how it is calculated. Churn is typically calculated as the percentage of customers that have stopped using a service over a specific period of time. For example, if a company has 100 customers and five of them cancel their subscription in a month, the churn rate for that month is 5%.

The impact of churn can be significant, as it not only represents lost revenue, but also the cost of acquiring new customers. It can also have a negative impact on the customer experience and overall brand perception. A high churn rate can indicate a problem with the product or service, a lack of differentiation in the market, or issues with the customer experience.

To prevent churn, it is important to understand the reasons why customers are leaving. A S.W.O.T. analysis can be a helpful tool in identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with the business and its customer experience. By conducting a thorough analysis, companies can gain valuable insights into the drivers of churn and develop strategies to address the root causes.

Additionally, understanding customer behavior and feedback can also play a critical role in preventing churn. This can be achieved through surveys, customer feedback mechanisms, and data analysis. By continuously monitoring and understanding customer behavior, businesses can stay ahead of potential issues and proactively address them before they result in churn. Churn is a metric that businesses must take seriously.

## ClickThrough Rate (CTR)

As a digital marketer, you want to ensure that your advertising efforts are producing results. One important metric that can help you measure the effectiveness of your campaigns is the ClickThrough Rate (CTR).

ClickThrough Rate (CTR) is a ratio that measures the number of clicks your ad receives divided by the number of impressions it receives. Impressions refer to the number of times your ad has been displayed, while clicks refer to the number of times someone has clicked on your ad. CTR is expressed as a percentage and gives you an idea of how well your ad is performing in terms of engagement.

CTR is an important metric in digital marketing because it helps you understand how well your ad campaigns are resonating with your target audience. A high CTR indicates that your ad is relevant and appealing to your audience, which can lead to higher conversions and sales. On the other hand, a low CTR suggests that your ad is not resonating well with your audience, and it may be time to reconsider your ad strategy.

To calculate CTR, divide the number of clicks your ad receives by the number of impressions it receives, and then multiply the result by 100 to express it as a percentage. For example, if your ad receives 1000 impressions and 10 clicks, your CTR would be 1%.

There are several factors that can influence CTR, including the relevance and appeal of your ad, the placement of your ad, and the target audience you are reaching.

There are several best practices you can follow to improve CTR, including:
- `Relevance`: Ensure that your ad is relevant to your target audience. The more relevant your ad is, the more likely it is to receive clicks.
- `Appeal`: Make sure your ad is visually appealing and includes a strong call to action.
- `Placement`: Place your ad in a location where it will receive maximum visibility and engagement, such as near relevant content or in a high-traffic area of your website.
- `Targeting`: Target your ad to your target audience, using factors such as age, location, and interests.
- `Testing`: Continuously test and refine your ad campaigns to improve CTR.

## Closed-Loop Marketing

Closed-loop marketing is a data-driven approach to marketing that helps businesses optimize their marketing efforts.  It is a feedback-based system that allows companies to measure the success of their marketing campaigns and make data-driven decisions to improve future campaigns.

The closed-loop marketing process starts with lead generation and ends with customer engagement and sales. At each step of the process, data is collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the marketing efforts. The data is then used to inform future marketing decisions and improve the overall strategy.

One of the key benefits of closed-loop marketing is that it provides businesses with a clear understanding of their target audience. By tracking the behavior of leads and customers, businesses can gather valuable insights into what works and what doesn't. Another benefit is that it allows businesses to quickly and easily measure the success of their marketing efforts. By tracking the number of leads generated, conversions, and sales, businesses can see the direct impact of their marketing campaigns and adjust their strategy accordingly.

For example, a company that uses a combination of email marketing and social media advertising to generate leads. The company tracks the success of the campaign by measuring the open rates and click-through rates of the emails, as well as the engagement on their social media ads. Based on the data collected, the company can then make informed decisions about the types of content to include in future campaigns and which channels to target.

## Comparative Advertising

The type of advertising in which a company makes a direct comparison to another brand, firm or organization.

## Content Management System (CMS)

A Content Management System, or CMS, is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish digital content without extensive technical knowledge. In the world of marketing, a CMS plays a crucial role in creating and maintaining a website or blog that is both user-friendly and SEO-optimized.

There are many popular examples of CMSs that are widely used today. WordPress, for example, is a popular open-source CMS that is used by millions of websites and blogs.  Joomla and Wix are also popular CMSs that offer a range of features for businesses of all sizes.

Content management systems are an essential tool for creating and maintaining a successful online presence. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, a CMS can help you improve the user experience for your visitors and increase your website's visibility in search engines.

Note from a developer (the guy that build this site): A CMS is great for getting started when you have no online presence and/or access to a developer. Keep in mind that these systems are a 60/40 solution, getting you 60% of the way there before you need to add more plugin/extensions. You usually end up needing a tech support for it. 

## Conversion Path

The path, or course of actions, a prospect will go through to eventually become a lead. These events can include a call to action, lead form, thank you page, downloadable content, etc.

## Conversion Rate

Percentage of people who take a desired action, such as filling out a form, registering, signing up for a newsletter, or any activity other than just browsing a web page.

## Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is the process of improving the performance of your website with the goal of increasing the number of conversions, or actions taken by visitors on your site. This could be anything from filling out a form, making a purchase, or signing up for a newsletter. CRO is a critical aspect of marketing because it helps you turn more of your website visitors into customers.

  To begin optimizing, it's important to understand your audience and what they're looking for on your website. This information can be gathered through user testing, website analytics, and surveys. You should also be familiar with your website's conversion funnel, which is the path a visitor takes from arriving on your site to taking the desired action. ome common CRO tactics include:
  - Improving the usability and user experience of your website
  - A/B testing different versions of your website or landing pages to see what works best
  - Offering incentives for taking desired actions, such as discounts or free trials
  - Streamlining the checkout process and reducing friction points
  - Personalizing the customer experience with targeted messaging and offers

  It's important to remember that CRO is an ongoing process and not a one-time fix. Regular testing and monitoring of your website's performance is essential to continually improve your conversion rate.
  
## Core Web Vitals

As a digital marketer, you know the importance of ensuring that your website is not only visually appealing, but also provides a smooth and enjoyable user experience. This is where Google's Core Web Vitals come into play. Google's Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure the user experience of a website, including loading speed, interactivity, and stability. These metrics are used by Google to determine the overall quality of a website and are an important factor in how the search engine ranks websites in its search results.

There are three key metrics that make up Google's Core Web:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Measures the loading speed of your website's largest content element, such as an image or video, and ensures that it loads within a reasonable time frame. 
- First Input Delay (FID) - Measures the time it takes for a website to become interactive, allowing users to click buttons, fill out forms, and interact with other elements on the page
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - Measures the stability of a website, ensuring that elements on the page don't shift or move around while the page is loading.

Improving your website's Core Web Vitals is crucial for ensuring that your website is providing a positive user experience and that it is ranking well in Google's search results. To improve your website's Core Web Vitals, consider optimizing your images, reducing the size of your website's code, and using a reliable and fast hosting service.

It can be applied to a wide range of materials, including business cards, stationery, packaging, and advertising. 

Corporate identity is often managed by a company's marketing or design department, and is typically developed with the help of a branding agency or graphic designer.

## Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) is a financial metric that measures the cost of acquiring a customer or converting a sale. In digital marketing, CPA is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns, such as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising or affiliate marketing.

CPA is calculated by dividing the total cost of a marketing campaign by the number of conversions or sales that it generates.

For example, if a business spends $1,000 on a PPC campaign and it generates 100 conversions, the CPA would be $10. CPA is an important metric for businesses, as it helps them to understand the cost of acquiring a customer and to optimize their marketing spend.

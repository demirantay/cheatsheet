## Misc

1 - Edit `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.poetry.scripts]
test = 'scripts:test'
```
2 - Create a `scripts.py` file on the root directory of your project:
```python
import subprocess

def test():
    """
    Run all unittests. Equivalent to:
    `poetry run python -u -m unittest discover`
    """
    subprocess.run(
        ['python', '-u', '-m', 'unittest', 'discover']
    )
```
3 - Run script:
```sh
poetry run test
```

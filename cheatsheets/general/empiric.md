# Empiric Knowledge

> This is very elementary at the moment but will change in the future

Empiric knowledge acquisiton model:
- 1 - Send out research carriers to monastries churches (this means research a lot of previous models on the subject you want)
- 2 - Rverse engineer your findings (study the shit out of them)
- 3 - Try to replicate for now
- 4 - Try to improve on them by Research and Development (dont forget 80/20)

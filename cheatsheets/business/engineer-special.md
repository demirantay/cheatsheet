- __Infrastructure:__
  - Sysadmin (managing, setting up, and keeping systems running)
  - Dev-ops (creating & using tools that devs use to manage systems)
  - Network Engineer (setting up, designing, and optimizing network infrastructures, TCP/IP, and other layers of the network stack)
  - Data Center Ops (they keep "the cloud" running)
  - Cable & Router Technicians (/r/cableporn)
  - Database Administrators (generally wizards)
  - Technical Support & Documentation (the incredibly tough bastards that actually deal with ghasp users)
- __Backend:__  
  - Full stack engineers (a little bit of everything)
  - Backend Application Development (rails, django, node, etc.)
  - Project Management (not always a technical technical role)
  - Engineering Management (usually former developers get promoted to this job)
  - Software Architects (planning out features before they are coded)
  - API Design (designing the interfaces between systems)
  - Security & Pentesting
  - Distributed System Architects (dealing with consistency, availability, partition tolerance, timing, of large, globally-separated systems)
  - Database Administrators (managing, maintaining, sharding, and migrating data stores, different from infrastructure-focused DBAs in that they are also writing backend code which interacts with the stores)
- __Frontend:__
  - Full Stack (a little bit of everything, but focused primarily on the pieces that support a frontend)
  - UX/UI Front end designers (photoshop, indesign, sketch, html & css, etc. only)
  - General front end web development (html, css, and js)
  - Single-page app development (mostly with JS frameworks, e.g. angular or react)
  - Quality Assurance & Testing (writing tests, doing human tests, making sure things work)
- __Native:__
  - iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, etc.
  - Consumer-facing Windows Desktop, OS X Desktop, Linux app development
  - Enterprise software development (large, made-to-order applications for businesses)
  - IT administration & admin software design (often very system-specific, hence the Native category)
  - Software Architecture (similar to backend architecture, designing features before they are coded)
- __Science and Theory:__
  - Scientific Research (loads of Matlab, R, and ipython and more)
  - "Pure Compsci/Pure Math" Research (with haskell, lisp, lots more)
  - Scientific Software Development (e.g. protein folding software)
  - Data science (matlab, r, ipython, scikit-learn, etc.)
  - Machine Learning (e.g. for pagerank, reverse image search, beer recommendation, used all over the place now)
  - Compiler & Language Design (not many jobs but very useful to learn, maybe mozilla foundation & rust?, and Guido certainly gets paid by Dropbox :)
  - OS Design (not just microsoft, windows, & linux, also qualcomm and lots of other telecoms hire tens of thousands of engineers to write embedded and mobile OSs)
  - Compression (you can work for Hooli)
- __Marketing:__
  - Growth hacking/web scraping (selenium, beatifulsoup, phantomjs, scikit-learn, pattern, etc.)
  - Analytics (GA, mixpanel, optimizely etc. closely tied with marketing and SEO)
  - SEO & SEM (techniques to fuck with/obey search engines and convert $$ to visitors)
  - General Marketing Development (salesforce, analytics, content-design, and SEO)
- __Hardware and Graphics:__
  - Embedded Software (code that runs very close to the metal, e.g. the assembly code running your elevator)
  - Chip Design & Architecture (wizards)
  - Game development (very, very different from other kinds of programmers, questionably human)
  - Graphics software development (similar to gaming dev, in my experience, graphics people don't frequently switch to app dev or vice versa
  - 3D printing and machining coding
  - CGI & Animation (e.g. disney. pixar devs gave a talk about the wonders of cgi development at Pycon2015)

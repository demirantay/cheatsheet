## CI/CD

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). It automates testing, building, and deploying code in stages, making development faster and more reliable.

- `Continuous Integration (CI)`: Developers frequently push small changes to the main repository. Each time, tests and builds run automatically. This ensures that code always works with others' contributions.
- `Continuous Deployment (CD)`: Once CI passes, the code is automatically deployed to production (Continuous Deployment). If you only prepare code for deployment without auto-deploying, it’s Continuous Delivery.

Benefits:
- Automation: No manual intervention is required for repetitive tasks.
- Speed: New features or bug fixes can be delivered quickly.
- Reliability: Automated testing ensures the quality of code before it’s deployed.
